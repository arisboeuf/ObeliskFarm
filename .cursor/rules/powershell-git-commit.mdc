# PowerShell-safe Git commits

When creating git commits in this repo on Windows/PowerShell:

- Use `required_permissions: ['all']` for git commands to avoid `.git/index.lock` permission issues.
- Do **not** use bash heredocs or bash-style redirections (they fail in PowerShell).
- Prefer a PowerShell here-string + `git commit -m <title> -m <body>` format.

Example:

```powershell
$title = '[TAG] component: short description'
$body = @'
WHY: Explain why this change was made.

Optional details if needed.
'@

git commit -m $title -m $body
```
