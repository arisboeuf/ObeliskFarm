# Default scope: `web/` only

- **Default target is the `web/` app.** When the user asks for changes without specifying scope, implement them in `web/`.
- **Do not change desktop/Python (“main” / `ObeliskGemEV/` etc.) unless the user explicitly asks.**
- Reading non-`web/` files for reference is allowed, but edits outside `web/` require explicit user instruction.
- If a request could be interpreted as either desktop or web, **assume web**.
