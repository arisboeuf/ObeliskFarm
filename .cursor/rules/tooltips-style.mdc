# Tooltips: project-wide style

- Write all tooltip text in English.
- Do not mention “desktop”, “desktop semantics”, “web port”, or comparisons to other UIs in tooltips. Describe the behavior directly.
- Use emphasis sparingly:
  - Avoid heavy bolding as a default style.
  - Only emphasize when it materially improves clarity.
- Prefer structured tooltips for complex topics:
  - Use `sections` with short headings (2–5 words).
  - Keep lines short and scannable (ideally 1 sentence per line).
- Keep content factual and implementation-aligned:
  - If behavior is subtle (e.g., cooldown state persists across MC sims), mention it plainly.
  - Avoid vague claims like “matches X” or “same as Y”.
